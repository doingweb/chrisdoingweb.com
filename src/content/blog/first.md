description: My first blog post, where I explain why I wanted to start blogging.

<p class="lead">I've been wanting to get into blogging about web and software development for a while now, at least since 2010, when I got my first full-time developer job.</p>

That's when I noticed just how much of our work involves learning through the vast accumulated knowledge of others who have written about it. Tutorials, deep-dives, thoughtful opinions, and quick tips from bloggers like [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/), [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/), [Chris Coyier](http://css-tricks.com/), [Phil Haack](http://haacked.com/), [Luke Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com/), and [Rob Dodson](http://robdodson.me/) have shaped me into the developer I am today. I'd like to continue that tradition, and try my best to contribute back to this amazing ecosystem, in whatever small way I can.

I hope you enjoy watching me stumble through my attempts to emulate all of my favorite bloggers. And even more, I hope you eventually find me interesting.

Thanks for reading!
