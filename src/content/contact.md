<p class="lead">There are a number of methods for contacting me, some more effective than others.</p>

There's the old standby: [email](mailto:chris@chrisdoingweb.com). As long as Gmail can tell you apart from spam and other mass-mailings, it should work well.

I'm [@doingweb](http://twitter.com/doingweb) on Twitter. A [direct message](https://twitter.com/direct_messages/create/doingweb) or even just a [mention](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=doingweb) should get my attention.

I rarely check my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisantes) messages.

If you're a [Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/user/doingweb), I can't miss a PM.

I can sometimes be found in the [HTML / CSS / WebDesign](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/29074/html-css-webdesign), [C#](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/7/c), and [JavaScript](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/17/javascript) rooms on StackOverflow.
